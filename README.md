# Big_data_analysis

## Overview
This repository contains six Jupyter notebooks demonstrating data analysis using Apache Spark. Each notebook focuses on different datasets and analytical approaches, showcasing the capabilities of Spark and PySpark for processing large-scale data. Topics covered include web server logs, geographic and economic data, air quality metrics, financial transactions, social network graphs, and statistical analysis.

## Notebooks

### 1. Web Server Log Analysis
Analyzes web server log files to extract insights such as request trends, popular browsers, file types accessed, and geographic distribution of users.

### 2. Economic and Geographic Data Exploration
Examines country-level economic, sociological, and geographic attributes, comparing wealth disparities and exploring relationships like airport density versus land area.

### 3. Air Quality Data Analysis
Processes air quality datasets to identify pollution trends, rank cities by air quality levels, and visualize pollution distribution over time and geography.

### 4. Real-Time Financial Data Streaming
Utilizes PySpark streaming to process financial transaction data, computing moving averages and demonstrating techniques for handling delayed data using watermarking.

### 5. Social Network Graph Analysis
Explores the structure of a social network graph, calculating key metrics such as the number of connections, node attributes, and overall graph connectivity.

### 6. Statistical and Machine Learning Analysis
Performs statistical exploration and machine learning tasks on structured datasets, including correlation analysis and classification modeling.
